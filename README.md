* **Data Analysis:** Includes basic Cohort Analysis to track product retention (simulated).

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
* Python 3.x
* Pandas (Data Manipulation)
* SQLite3 (Database)
* NumPy (Numerical Analysis)

## 📊 How to Run
1.  Clone this repository.
2.  Open the `.ipynb` file in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook.
3.  Run the cells sequentially to initialize the database and perform the analysis.
